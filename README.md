# Will-o'-Wisp

[Live Demo](https://will-o-wisp.herokuapp.com/#/)

Will-o'-Wisp is a photo sharing website inspired by Flickr. It makes use of Rails/PostgreSQL backend with React.js and Redux on the frontend.

The project was designed and built within a 10-day timeframe. However, I plan to continue to add improvements and new features over time.

## Features

* Secure frontend to backend user authentication using BCrypt.
* Users can see all the photos and albums ever uploaded and created.
* Users can upload photos and edit the text associated with the photos only if they are the owner.
* Users can create albums with photos that they own and make as many albums as they want.
* Users can comment directly on the photo's show page and see their comment appear.
* Users can add tags directly to the photo on the photo's show page.

### Photo Show Page
The photo page has both the comments and tags section
